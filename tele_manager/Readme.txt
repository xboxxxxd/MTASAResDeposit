INSTALLATION

1. Extract the contents of this resource into a FOLDER
2. Place the folder with the contents into your server's resource directory

NOTE: You HAVE to have this resource as a folder resource instead of a ZIP resource. This is because the teleports will NOT be written to the file unless it is unpacked into the folder. This is NOT an option.


RESOURCE DESCRIPTION:
This is a resource which allows admins to create special teleports throughout san andreas using a user friendly GUI. These teleports will be saved into an XML file within the resource. Later on the list of resources can be easily edited by using the Teleport Manager's user friendly GUI to either add or remove a teleport from the list.

NOTE: You do NOT have to stop/restart/refresh/upgrade or interrupt your servers operation in order to see newly added teleports. Each time a teleport is added it is instantly saved into the XML file within the resource. Every time the GUI is opened on a client, that XML file is reread from within the resource.


INSTRUCTIONS:
	Opening the Teleport Manager: type the following command in. /tele
	Closing the Teleport Manager: press the close button at the bottom of the GUI OR type the following command in. /tele
	Using a Teleport: Navigate through the list of available teleports and click to highlight the teleport you would like to use. Click the "Use Teleport" button.
	Adding a Teleport: *ADMIN ONLY FEATURE* Press the "Add Teleport" button. Fill in all the required information into the new popup window. Once done click the "Add Teleport" button at the bottom of the popup window.
	Deleting a Teleport: *ADMIN ONLY FEATURE* Navigate through the list of available teleports and click to highlight the teleport you would like to delete. Click the "Delete Teleport" button to delete the highlighted teleport.
	
	TIP: I have included a "Get Cur Pos" button within the popup window so you can easily add your current location and rotation when you are adding teleports. To use it just get into the position and rotation you would like to be the warp to location and click "get cur pos". Once done the X, Y, Z, and rotation fields should be filled with the corresponding information.
